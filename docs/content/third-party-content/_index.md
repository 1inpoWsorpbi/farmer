  - Here's a Farmer-generated @azure ARM template for a VM. Nine lines of #fsharp (and look - even curly braces ;-)) gives a 135-line, fully-configured and parameterised template. Creating custom disk configurations is easy, as per the screenshots. https://github.com/CompositionalIT/farmer

  - Holy moly, this was a breeze! Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes. I'm SO going to use this more often, even if it's just to get a baseline for a customer. Saves tons of time! Sidenote: I've just written my first 19 lines of #fsharp

  - Hey @isaac_abraham, #Farmer is kind of awesome. A few lines and my fav env is created. #ILike Do you have any samples how to deploy #AzureFunctions from DevOps to previously with Farmer created infrastructure?
