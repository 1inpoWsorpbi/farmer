# Farmer

An F# DSL for rapidly generating non-complex ARM templates. This isn't a replacement for ARM templates,
nor some sort of compete offering with Pulumi or similar. It's designed mostly as an experiment at this stage -
things will change rapidly and there will be lots of breaking changes both in terms of namespace and API design.

**THIS IS PROTOTYPE CODE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## How can I help?
Try out the DSL and see what you think.

* Create as many issues as you can for both bugs
* Create suggestions for features and the most important elements you would like to see added

The is prototype code. There **will** be massive breaking changes on a regular basis.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. Build the Farmer project.
3. Try one of the sample scripts in the Samples folder.
4. Alternatively, create a console application, reference the Farmer assembly and try from that.
